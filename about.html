    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>Nathan’s love of building started as a youngster when he accompanied his builder Dad, John Wood to
    building sites. He loved watching his Dad work and decided at a young age that he was also going to
    be a builder. At 12 years of age he started his first big project, helping his Dad build a sleepout. As a
    teenager he took on holiday jobs helping out on building sites and he couldn’t wait to leave school to
    start his building apprenticeship. Fast forward quite a few years, and Nathan is a qualified builder and
    a Licensed Building Practitioner with his own building company.</p>

    <p>Building runs in the family which has seen Nathan soak up knowledge about different aspects of the
    industry, however his key mentor was his Dad, who had an extensive building background as a
    builder, builder inspector and building instructor. He loved teaching Nathan about best practice
    building to ensure everything they created was built to last. John established At Wood Homes in
    2007 and in 2024 after working as a builder and site foreman for other builders, Nathan took over
    the reins of At Wood Homes and now takes on building projects across Auckland.
    Nathan has worked on a range of building projects from building high-end new family homes, to
    home renovations, kitchens, bathrooms along with outside projects including decks, fences and
    maintenance jobs that need done around the house.</p>

    <p>Nathan is supported by his fiancée Carlotta who is becoming more involved in the business and
    helping with administration as well as looking after their young daughter.
    If you need help with a building project give Nathan a call – he is happy to have a chat and come and
    look at your project.</p>
